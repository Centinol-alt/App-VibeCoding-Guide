# App-Vibe-Coding-Guide

## Getting Started
To begin vibe coding, you only need two tools:  
- **Grok 3 Thinking**  
- **Cursor with Claude Sonnet 3.7 Thinking**  

Setting up everything correctly is key. If you’re serious about creating a fully functional and visually appealing app, take the time to establish a solid foundation.  

**Key Principle:** *Planning is everything.* Do NOT let the AI plan autonomously, or your codebase will become an unmanageable mess.

---

## Setting Up Everything

### 1. App Design Document
- Take your app idea and ask **Grok 3 Thinking** to create a simple **App Design Document** in Markdown format (`.md`).  
- Review and refine the document to ensure it aligns with your vision. It’s fine if it’s basic—the goal is to give your AI context about the app’s structure and intent.  

### 2. Tech Stack and `.cursor/rules`
- Ask **Grok 3 Thinking** to recommend the best tech stack for your app (e.g., React, Svelte, etc.).  
  - Challenge it to propose the *simplest yet most robust stack possible*.  
- Prompt Grok to write a set of 6-10 rules for Cursor as if it’s a senior app developer specializing in your chosen stack.  
  - Ensure one rule emphasizes **modularity** (multiple files) and avoids a **monolith** (one giant file).  
  - Example: Rules might include best practices for networking or performance optimization.  
  - *This is mandatory if you want an app that is as optimized as possible, with clean code.*

### 3. Implementation Plan
- Provide **Grok 3 Thinking** with:  
  - The App Design Document  
  - The tech stack recommendations  
  - The Cursor rules  
- Ask it to create a detailed **Implementation Plan** in Markdown (`.md`) with step-by-step instructions for your AI developers.  
  - Steps should be small and specific.  
  - Each step must include a test to validate correct implementation.  
  - No code—just clear, concrete instructions.  
  - Focus on the *base app*, not the full feature set (details come later).  

### 4. Review the Implementation Plan and Code Structure
- After the AI generates the implementation plan, **review it thoroughly** to ensure it aligns with your vision and is feasible.  
- Examine the proposed code structure for modularity and clarity. If needed, ask Grok 3 to refine it.  
- **Tip:** Look for potential risks (e.g., tight dependencies, complex integrations) and plan mitigations (e.g., fallback options, buffer time).

### 5. Project Docs
- Create a new folder in your apps root called `/project-docs`.  
- Add the following sub-folders & files:  
  Subfolder: `design'
  > Outlines design strategies and system architecture. Includes UI/UX design plans and architectural overviews.

    Files:
  • `app-design.md`
  • `architecture.md`

  Subfolder: `guides`
  > Provides reference materials and guidelines. Includes file structure guides and workflow rules.

    Files:
      • `.cursor/rules`
      • `file-guide.md`

  Subfolder: `planning`
  > Details strategic plans for project execution. Covers implementation and migration strategies.

    Files:
      • `implementation-plan.md`

  Subfolder: `progress`
  > Tracks the development status of the project. Add to it after each Phase/Step is implemented, then push your commit.

    Files: `progress.md`

  Subfolder: `setup`
  > Offers instructions for setting up the project environment. Contains setup guides for Databases, S3 buckets, Cloudflare etc (whatever you're using).

    Files:
      • `tech-stack.md`

#### Recommendations:
1. If you want to change something moderate-big then create a new `implementation-plan` for it with a new `progress` document as well. For exampple, lets say you want to change the UI, create a new `UI-design-plan.md` (name it as you wish but keep in mind that the plan is for the LLM to understand how to implement what you want, which is why the `/project-docs` structure is as it is [helps the LLM understand better] so the naming of your documents is also important) with a corresponding `progress` document separate to the original one for the first `implementation-plan.md`.

2. When creating a new implementation plan use Grok 3 thinking or Claude 3.7 sonnet thinking (or Opus) to create the plan, discuss with the LLM until you have the plan finalized to your vision.

3. Create a `README.md` in the root of `/project-docs` that explains the purpose of /project-docs, this helps the LLM understand more. Include a Folder Structure section and Purpose section.

### 6. Setup `.cursor/rules`
- In Cursor, press `Cmd + Shift + P`, type "rules", and hit Enter.  
- Input the rules generated by Grok 3 from Step 2.

## Vibe Coding the Base App
Now the fun begins!

### Making Sure Everything Is Clear
- Select **Claude Sonnet 3.7 Thinking** in Cursor.  
- Prompt: "Read all the documents in `/project-docs`. Is `implementation-plan.md` clear? What are your questions to make it 100% clear for you?"  
- Answer any questions Claude asks to clarify the plan.  
- Prompt Claude to edit `implementation-plan.md` accordingly to improve it.  

### Your First Implementation Prompt
- Select **Claude Sonnet 3.7 Thinking** in Cursor.  
- Prompt:  
  "Read all the documents in `/project-docs`, and proceed with Step 1 of the implementation plan. I will run the tests. Do not start Step 2 until I validate the tests. Once I validate them, open `progress.md` and document what you did for future developers. Then add any architectural insights to `architecture.md` to explain what each file does."

- **Alternative Prompt 1:**  
  "Read all the documents in `/project-docs`, and proceed with Phase 1 of the implementation plan. Once Phase 1 is complete, open `progress.md` and document what you did for future developers. Then add any architectural insights to `architecture.md` to explain what each file does but don't include any code."

- **Alternative Prompt 2:**  
  "Read all the documents in `/project-docs`, and proceed with Phase 1 of the implementation plan. Once Phase 1 is complete, open `progress.md` and document what you did for future developers. Then add any architectural insights to `architecture.md` to explain what each file does but don't include any code, and update `file-guide.md` to describe any new code files created."

- **Extreme vibe:** Install [Superwhisper](https://superwhisper.com) to speak casually with Claude instead of typing.  

### Workflow
- After completing Step 1:  
- **Review the AI-Generated Code:**  
  - Manually inspect the code to ensure comprehension, especially for critical components.  
  - Check for:  
    - Potential performance bottlenecks (e.g., inefficient loops, heavy computations).  
    - Security risks (e.g., unvalidated inputs, exposed secrets).  
    - Misalignments with the design or requirements.  
  - Document findings in `progress.md` if adjustments are made.  
- **Run the Tests:**  
  - Execute the tests specified in the implementation plan.  
- **Enhanced Testing:**  
  - Review test results and verify coverage of critical paths.  
  - Use code coverage tools (if available) to ensure robustness.  
  - Log results and coverage details in `testing-log.md`.  
- Commit your changes to Git.  
- Start a new composer (`Cmd + N`, `Cmd + I`).  
- Prompt: "Now go through all files in the memory-bank, read `progress.md` to understand prior work, and proceed with Step 2. Do not start Step 3 until I validate the test."  
- Repeat this process until the entire `implementation-plan.md` is complete.

## Adding Details
Congratulations, you’ve built the base app! It might be rough and lack features, but now you can experiment and refine it.  
- For each major feature, create a new `implementation-plan.md` file with short steps and tests.  
- Implement and test incrementally.  
- **Iterative Refinement:** After each feature, review feedback (e.g., from testing or users) and adjust the code or plan as needed.  

---

## Fixing Bugs and Stuckness
- If a prompt fails or breaks the app:  
- Click “restore” in Cursor and refine your prompt until it works.  
- For errors:  
- **If JavaScript:** Open the console (`F12`), copy the error, and paste it into Cursor—or provide a screenshot for visual glitches.  
- **Lazy Option:** Install [BrowserTools](https://browsertools.agentdesk.ai/installation) to skip manual copying/screenshotting.  
- If stuck:  
- Revert to your last Git commit (`git reset`) and retry with new prompts.  
- If *really* stuck:  
- Use [RepoPrompt](https://repoprompt.com/) and ask **Grok 3 Thinking** for assistance.

## Handling AI Limitations
- AI-generated code may have weaknesses, such as missing edge cases or suboptimal performance. To address this:  
- **Manual Review:** Regularly inspect the code for common AI pitfalls (e.g., overcomplicated logic, unhandled errors).  
- **Stress Testing:** Test critical features under extreme conditions (e.g., slow networks, large inputs).  
- **Optimization:** Manually refine code where necessary and document changes in `progress.md`.

## Other Tips
- **Small Edits:** Use Claude Sonnet 3.5.  
- **Great Copywriting:** Use GPT-4.5.  
- **Better Prompt Outputs:** Add "Think as long as needed to get this right; I am not in a hurry. What matters is that you follow precisely what I ask and execute it perfectly. Ask me questions if I am not precise enough."  
- **Documentation:** Keep `project-docs` files detailed and up-to-date for future reference or collaboration.
