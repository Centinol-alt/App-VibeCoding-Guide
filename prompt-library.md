# Prompt Library:

## Progress Implementation Verification:
- Sometimes after prompting Claude to implement a particular step or phase it does not fully implement it. I've had experiences where I ask Claude if the step/plan is fully implemented, using the first of the 2 prompt's below, and Claude replies with a break down of what has been implemented and more importantly - what has not been implemented (bastard).
```bash
Have all the steps in phase/step X been fully implemented
```
Or:
```bash
Has all of this been fully implemented:

*copy-paste the entire step/phase
```
